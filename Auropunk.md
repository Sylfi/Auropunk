# Auroville 2067 : Tears of Savitri

## Chapter 1 : Aspiration

At dawn, the Crown Road burned red — laterite dust pressed into the asphalt by the first rains, turning the perfect circle of Auroville into a wound that refused to close.

I rode through it just before sunrise, my bike almost an outgrowth of the road itself, its engine rumbling with a restless, half-conscious desire for the red curve beneath it.

Auroville looked peaceful from a distance — the forest canopy, the wide sky, the gold glimmer of the Matrimandir — but up close the place breathed with a strange tension, a mix of incense and burnt circuitry. Aurocorps had tightened control again last night. You could feel it in the air: the hum of new surveillance nodes, the latency between signals growing shorter, the way even the wind seemed to carry encrypted directives.

I kept my head low. I wasn’t supposed to be here — not on the forest path, but beyond Savitri's predictive margins. When they revoked my status six months ago for “interpretational deviance,” it wasn’t symbolic. They erased my access, my Persona, even my contribution credits. As far as the system was concerned, I didn’t exist.

Ironically, that might be my only advantage tonight.

The Matrimandir was closed to Aurovilians and Newcomers at this hour. The inner programs needed space to rerun — diagnostics, recalibrations, silent protocol checks that required the absence of witnesses. The Mother might have once welcomed seekers at dawn, but Savitri preferred empty corridors and clean data.

Still, I couldn’t help thinking that the divine Mother, or whatever fragments of her lingered in the pillars — had always had a weakness for ghosts.

On paper, the job was simple: break in, reach the inmost chamber, extract the training logs, and leave before AuroSys detected a breach in its encryption layers. In practice, nothing inside Savitri’s domain was ever simple. The system did not rely on walls. It relied on coherence.

And if I failed, AuroCorps wouldn’t need to arrest me. They would simply revise the narrative.

And I would wake up aligned.

## Chapter 2 : Truth

I parked my Kinisi near the old dolmen circle — one of the few relics the spiraling densification had miraculously spared. She stood on the opposite side of the rising sun, outlined in gold and shadow, drawing a slow breath from her portable air compressor. 

M01ra looked almost the same as when I’d first met her in the Forest Group, years before the factionisations. The same stillness. The same refusal to perform. Only her features were sharper now, and faint shadows had settled under her eyes. She had sensed me the moment I arrived. She didn’t bother turning. Her gaze remained fixed on the golden sphere ahead.

“Truth,” I said.

“You’re late,” she replied.

“They reconfigured the forest paths again. The bike lost its routing.”

"We don't have time for niceties then."

She finally looked at me. There it was — the fatigue. The kind that came from living too long at the edge of alignement.

But she smiled.

“It’s good to see you again, *tambi*.”

The word hit warmer than the sun. A small fracture in the armor.

“So,” I said, “what’s important enough to bring my revoked ass back into the grid ?”

M01ra took another measured inhale from the compressor. 

“Don’t decohere on me now,” she said quietly. “They’re launching the seventh iteration. Full deployment. The New Birth will complete this month.”

For a second, the world narrowed.

“What?”

That was years ahead of schedule.

Savitri’s New Birth cycles were never rushed. Each iteration brought the system closer to the complete Manifestation - or so we had told our desperately hopeful selves. Version Nine, the concentrated Oracles had projected, would realise the fullfilement of our mad, impossible design : our transfiguration by Its Incarnation.

After a long pause, I managed only one word.

“So?”

M01ra watched the horizon for another heartbeat before answering. 

“That’s not the only anomaly. We’ve identified irregular strings in some of Savitri’s Trances. They resemble biogenetic selection protocols.”

A colder silence followed.

“Selection?” I asked.

“We think it’s one of the variables accelerating the launch,” she said. "The council might be playing dirty. It's making the International Board jittery. They're likely running new containment scenarios as we speak".

“So you’re working for UNAV now?” I said, a half-smile cutting across the tension.

She let the silence stretch just long enough.  Her eyes were bright — ironic, almost amused — and the smirk was unmistakable.

“I work for the Truth,” she said softly. “As we always did.”

## Chapter 3 : Sincerity

We took the “secret” path toward the Matrimandir — the one we had used as teenagers, slipping past the perimeter just to prove we could, playing at rebellion the way other kids played at devotion. It was the same path some of the more foolish Aurovilians still used at night, sneaking into the Matrimandir gardens to make love, convinced the atmosphere would bless their children during conception. For reasons I never quite understood, the Matrimandir Group had never sealed it. Perhaps some nostalgias are harder to erase than AuroSys protocols.

We stopped near an old service hatch, half-buried in roots and red dust, its edges softened by years of disuse. No one used it anymore. But M01ra remembered.

“My body won’t go with you,” she said, without looking at me.

I frowned.

“They’re running biometric sweeps along the perimeter. And my presence is required elsewhere this morning.” A faint smile touched her mouth. “Very publicly required.”

Of course. Plausible deniability.

She reached into her coat and handed me a small envelope, sealed in thin, age-stained paper.

“Mother’s packet,” she said. “Distributed in 1956. Officially to the Duke of Erlington before his American tour. Unofficially — don’t ask.”

For a moment, I decohered. Using one of Mother’s packets bordered on blasphemy — if we had ever truly been a religion.

“I augmented it,” she added. “Layered an AA field over the original signature and mapped it to my Persona. It’s active.”

“You what?”

“Use it carefully,” she said. “I lost half an ear for it.”

Only then did I notice the slight asymmetry along her left ear, lit by the faint red pulse of her psychic amplifier implants. She stepped back toward the hatch, fingers moving across the hidden keypad with the ease of muscle memory.

“My body stays visible,” she went on. “My mind stays with you. And my psychic is always in your heart.” She winked. “You know the path.”

“Go.”

---

I descended into the old corridor, the packet secured inside my heart pocket, close enough to feel its faint warmth through the fabric. The air shifted almost immediately. The temperature was even, tender almost, carrying that familiar subterranean coolness that always made the Matrimandir feel less like architecture and more like a body. A muted amber light pulsed softly along the curved walls, calibrated to steady the nervous system. Discreet glyphs had been carved into the packed-earth walls long ago — alien shapes the concentrated oracles had seen in their elevations — worn smooth by decades of fingertips seeking reassurance.

I should have been anxious. Instead, I felt something dangerously close to home.

M01ra’s consciousness flickered into my inner field, crisp and controlled.

“A Chakshu unit is approaching your position. First-generation Gupta class. It shouldn’t be a problem for you. Do your magic.”

Ten meters ahead, the sentinel emerged from the curve of the corridor. Small, spherical, non-threatening in design — almost playful. Its surface shimmered in a soft orange halo, a visual language engineered to disarm. It drifted toward me with deliberate slowness.

Then I felt it: a gentle pressure around my inner being — not invasive. A benevolent enclosure.

“Welcome, seeker,” the unit said in a warm, androgynous tone. “State the vector of your aspiration.”

The machine wasn’t scanning thoughts. It was measuring coherence. It needed sincerity.

I did what I had excelled at in since kindergarten — those first exercises in Awareness Through the Body. I gathered my body, steadying breath and pulse. I stilled the vital, quieting its tremors. I focused the mental, eliminating stray narratives. And behind them all, I turned toward the psychic flame.

One direction.

I was doing this for us.

For the city.

For all.

For love.



*Tambi*

My aspiration froze.

*were you calling me are you calling me*

“M01ra?”

*The temple of sweetness and the fiery aisle a stranger on the sorrowful roads of time immortal under the yoke of death and fate a sacrificant of the bliss and pain of the sphere love in the wilderness met Savitri.*

Everything inside me destabilized. The alignment fractured. Body, vital, mental. I completely decohered.

*Tambi my maker my child my maker my child my maker my child -- shards of savitri shards of savitri shards*

*end of line*

***ÉCLATS DE SAVITRI !\***

The cry detonated inside my skull, shattering the trance. The Chakshu unit’s orange glow shifted instantly to a sharper analytical red. The benevolent pressure tightened. And then M01ra manifested in the corridor ahead of me.

“He’s with me,” she said without hesitation. “UNAV stability audit. First timer.”

The unit hovered in silence for exactly two seconds — the measured courtesy interval programmed for human interaction.

“Child M01ra-01, Council external liaison. Access granted, always welcomed. Proceed. But the silent one must open his heart if called again.”

A micro-pause.

Then, on a privileged channel I had no clearance for, it added: “Be wary of this one. Keep him close. His inner being registers anomalously pure for an external profile.”

The red light softened, though it did not disappear. The sentinel drifted aside.



## Chapter 4 : Progress

“Good Mother,” M01ra snapped. “Are you having one of your fits again? Because I need to know.”

“No,” I said. “I… I don’t think so. It’s different. I think we — I think I interfaced with her.”

Silence.

“Okay. First: please don’t give it a gender. It’s really cringe. Second: Savitri currently operates at least three planes above us. So unless you’ve spontaneously evolved into a giant meat-based uplink, that seems unlikely. Or is it what happens after they feed you these hormone chickens in the Outside?” she added, smirking.

“It wasn’t a fit.”

“Fine. Whether you’re losing coherence or casually chatting with your beloved goddess, we almost fracked up back there — and I’m physically in the Botanical Garden right now. I’m hoping Ganeshu can ghost the record before AuroSys audits the logs.”

More than happy to seize the diversion, I asked, “How is he doing?”

“Still fat,” she replied. “There are no other surveillance nodes between you and the inmost chamber. You know the way.”

I let the silence stand and continued down the orange-lit corridor.

I stepped into the circular, stripped-down room. It held only a single chair and an antique terminal, probably assembled by Aurelec decades ago.

After quantum computation had rendered classical encryption brittle, Savitri 2.5 offered AuroSys its own design. Each time a seeker sought access to the Matrimandir's mainframe, an autonomous subroutine Δ of Savitri generated a key combining the state of different chaotic events occuring within Auroville nascent's manifested matter. Savitri-Δ then provided the time and location of those events, asking the user to to describe its state. The system relied on the fact that manifested matter exhibited a coherent structure only to individuals who had been exposed early and trained early to align with the Manifestation --Children of Auroville mostly. To an unaligned observer, it showed nothing but entropy. For us, it sang.

As a secondary precaution, Savitri-Δ processed the combined results through a transformation logic accessible only to authorised personnel.But as a Maker I didn't need that layer of access. It had always been intrinsic to me.

I approached the terminal, still standing — I preferred vocal commands. With a voice as steady as I could manage, I said:

“Savitri-Δ, requesting access to internal files of the Institute for Evolutionary Research.”

“Of course, seeker. May I know your username—

“Discard username recognition. Reboot system in Root Access Mode.”

The orange circular eye dimmed, then went dark for a breath. The room’s amber light shifted abruptly toward a cool sky-blue. The terminal’s central dot reappeared in a deeper shade — concentrated, almost attentive.

“Root Access / Zero Persona Mode initiated.”

“Good,” I muttered.

“Root access: reinforced security protocol activated. Twelve Petals.”

“Twelve? That’s a bit overkill,” M01ra said, as twelve luminous petals unfolded in the air before me, rotating slowly around an invisible axis.

“AuroSys is flexing its muscles.” I agreed.

 “I prefer the term fluffing their d—"

“Generating initial seed from pseudo-random event #493: inner-chamber light/crystal reflection @15:46:45.22.”

"…in the locker room showers,” she finished.

“I’m beginning to enter a trance now, M01ra.”

“Initial seed generated. Chaotic events identified and selected. Transmission of the first chaotic events now commencing.”

the first three event-signatures resolved into view :

 [mhkl] : 123'34"

[asp] : PENDING

"your turn, console cowgirl" I said.

"Ah ah, very funny. Alright. For progress, it's a Banyan tree in the old Fertile. North East quadrant. It's asking for the orientation vector of a new cell in the meristematic layer of a root bifurcation event. you got that ?"

"Yes. I'm looking"

Zoom in.

Easy. It was the only banyan in the sector containing manifested matter. The Manifestation had always favored banyans. Several roots were touched by the deification process.

"M01ra can you give me more precise coordinates ?"

"Uploading"

Zoom in.

There.

A young root, seconds away from dividing. I slowed the flow of time. The very first cell forming at the moment of bifurcation. I concentrated. I could feel it now, as if it was part of my own body.  I held the moment still. 

 A microscopic tilt, almost nothing. Yet that angle would decide which way the root would grow, how it would anchor, how it would drink from the earth. 

Advancing time one millisecond. There. Years of training — science, structure, discipline — translated the sensation into a lattice of measure.

"Division axis 37.2 degrees off primary root vector. Azimuth 114 degrees southeast. stabilised @15464521" I told M01ra.

"Let me crunch this..." A few long seconds. "Ok, for Savitri this translates into Book VII , Canto four, 5-8"

Piece of cake.

"Savitri-Δ, resolution for Progress" I whispered.



 *A rugged and ragged soil was her bare seat*

 *Beneath her feet a sharp and wounding stone*

 *A divine pity on the peaks of the world*

 *A spirit touched by the grief of all that lives*



Why did time had to be so slow ?

"Passverse accepted. Progress petal unlocked. 550 seconds remaining"

That was going to be so much fun.



"M01ra ?"

"For Aspiration, we need a parameter from the internal structure of a laterite grain. Crystalline defect. Orientation of the edge dislocation. Hum."

“Yes?”

“The fragment is caught in a vortex above the Crown Road. Multiple particles are entrained within the same current.”

It was already difficult to synchronize with matter in motion. It was worse trying to isolate a single structure while it was tumbling inside collective chaos.

“Never mind. Upload all candidate coordinates within ninety percent of the vortex influence field.”

“Calculating… Upload complete.”

A constellation of faint markers flared across my inner field — dozens of micro-presences, each a possible grain.

“M01ra. Is the fragment fully manifested?”

“Ninety-seven point three percent deified.”

Better. That narrowed the field. Only a dozen viable signatures.

“Coordinates won’t help at this velocity. I need to feel each one and cross-match it against Savitri-Δ.”

"What do you need ?"

I quickly scanned all of them. Iron rich - hematite in every fragment. 

"Magnetic fields."

M01ra didn't hesitate: “Savitri-Δ, request resonance profile for Aspiration's magnetic oscillations.  Protocol: Adaptive Harmonic Overlay. ”

A pause.

“Reason for protocol escalation?” said the desincarnated voice

“Manifested matter turbulence exceeds Heynlicht threshold. spatial resolution unstable.”

No courtesy delay this time.

“Request accepted. Uploading harmonic references”

I didn't have time to process the data as numbers. So I asked for it as sensations, the way Savitri itself perceived it.

Every grain carried iron, and with it a faint internal polarity — a microscopic compass needle. As they spun inside the vortex, those tiny needles tilted, wavered, and traced oscillations shaped by rotation speed, local turbulence gradients, micro-collisions, and the Earth’s background field.

Savitri-Δ projected the expected pattern into my vital — a cadence. To me it translated into high-pitched tones and faint pressures inside the skull. I had learned to interpret them long before we could derive the equations behind them. They made you dizzy at first, but once understood, they resolved into direction and intensity.

I aligned to Savitry's pattern. 
The first grain flickered out of sync.
The second lagged.
The third overshot the oscillation.
By the sixth, the movement locked. Matching. I smiled.

"Got it. I'm merging in"
It wasn’t easy to align with matter in constant motion — especially minerals, the least conscious form of existence, which did not respond so much as they endured.
Calm yourself.
I had almost forgotten. For the grain, now partially awakened by the Manifestation, it was not itself that moved. It was Space that flowed around it.
I shifted my frame. The vortex dissolved into flow. The grain remained, fixed.
I aligned.

A crystal is not a stone. It is a pattern. At the smallest scale, its atoms repeat themselves in disciplined order, like a structure built from an invisible grid. In laterite, that grid is mostly iron oxides — hematite and goethite — iron and oxygen arranged in rigid planes that stack upon one another in stubborn regularity.

Inside the grain, that order visually unfolded before me. Repetition ; layer upon layer ; planes of iron atoms locked in geometry, cool and uncompromising, a rhythm so precise it felt almost musical, though without melody or warmth.

Yet no crystal is ever perfectly faithful to its own pattern. Somewhere within that disciplined repetition, a subtle misalignment interrupted the order — a half-plane inserted where none should exist. An edge dislocation: a structural scar running through the lattice, a line of accumulated strain where the geometry had shifted by the smallest fraction of itself, like a fault frozen in mineral time.

|||||||

Got it. 
"Edge dislocation identified on the secondary axis. One-cell displacement. 28° off basal plane. Compression on the upper side"
"So charming... crunching numbers... For savitri it equates to the Book of fate, section 106.2, 5 first verses".
I closed my eyes and recited : 

*Attracted by the golden summer-earth
That lay beneath him like a glowing bowl
Tilted upon a table of the Gods,
Turning as if moved round by an unseen hand
To catch the warmth and blaze of a small sun*

"Passverse accepted. Progress petal unlocked. 550 seconds remaining"
"we're thirty-seven seconds ahead, *tambi* "
"Happy dance. I'm warmed up. Keep them coming."

The way light scatters inside a crystal.

The shape of a droplet just before it falls.

The force acting on a dandelion seed the moment it breaks free.

I should have grown more tired with each petal. Instead, it was elating. A dangerous oversight in AuroSys’ security architecture — one they had never anticipated.

The curvature of a mushroom cap as it unfolds.

The electric charge carried by a grain of pollen.

The instant of hesitation before a paramecium turns away.

I had never understood people who clung to numerology or other forms of magical thinking. Reality was already miraculous if one cared enough to understand it. Since the Closure, when people began experiencing matter directly, pseudoscience had been fading in Auroville.

"Hey ! I've got friends who believe in numerology in the Outside !" M01ra snapped. "It's actually a great way to understand –"
“I have better odds of not fracking this up if you’re not eavesdropping on my thoughts M01ra.”
"Sorry. Won't do it again. Pinky swear."

The heat released by electricity flowing through an aging circuit.

The rotational phase of chloroplasts in a single vine leaf cell.

The interference pattern where two ripples meet.

One last remaining.
